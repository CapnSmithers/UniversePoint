Ideas to implement:

- Database storage for teams
- Dynamic UI for score input

TODO:
- Fix player view screen (back button causes crash)
- Get player stats from database on player view screen
- Implement saved game viewing (not critical - can get rid of if we need)
- Populate player list on score-keeping screen
- Allow for updating of player/game info on scorekeeping screen (PlayerEdit class)
- Put up game summary screen
